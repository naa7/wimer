The idea of this project is to build a terminal based work timer. It uses zenity to ask a user for the required 
time to start counting down. The user can either enter hours and minutes, hours without minutes, or minutes 
without hours, it accepts all. There are two ways to start the timer. First, the program will run in the 
current terminal window and when it ends, the output will be removed. Second, the program will run in a new 
window of a set size (20x10) to save screen space for other tasks and once program ends, the timer terminal 
window will close. In both ways, Once the timer stops, a 2 second alert will start and a notification pop up 
window will apear to notify user of the end of program.



## There are two ways to run the program

 Clone the repository:
  
    $ cd && git clone https://github.com/naa7/work_timer.git

 #### Choice 1, The program will run in the current terminal window

  1) Change Directory to `work_timer`. Example:

    $ cd && cdwork_timer/

  2) Run the program:
 
    $ sh workTimer 


 #### Choice 2, The program will run in a new window which will close after the program ends:
   
  1) Change Directory to `work_timer`. Example:

    $ cd && cd work_timer/

  2) Make the program & launcher executable:

    $ chmod +x workTimer work_timer

  3) Run `work_timer`:

    $ ./work_timer 


## Optional

For easier use of the timer without the need to navigate to its directory and run the file,

run `install.sh`
   
    $ sh install.sh

Now, you can either open it from terminal

    $ work_timer

Or, open it from applications menu

To uninstall, run:

    $ sh uninstall.sh
